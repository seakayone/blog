= Do not write your .gitignore if you are lazy

For some people it is well and good to have a nicely handcrafted `.gitignore` in their project.
However, I myself am super lazy.

I do not want to have to answers like:

* Which new files does my IDE generate in its newest release?
* Is there something different with the latest other tool (`gradle`, `ng`, you name it)?
* and more....

Save yourself some time and use https://www.gitignore.io/[gitignore.io].

I use a small shell function which allows me to live in the shell and create the file on the fly:

[source,shell]
--
gi () {
  curl -sLw "\n" https://www.gitignore.io/api/$@
}
--

This way with a simple one liner `gi gradle,java,intellij > .gitignore` my newest project is safely git ignored.

Templates are plenty and updated regularly: https://github.com/toptal/gitignore

For oh-my-zsh users there is even a handy https://docs.gitignore.io/use/advanced-command-line#oh-my-zsh[plugin with autocompletion].

Go get it.
