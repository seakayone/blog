Use the following on your own risk! Deactivating the Kubernetes health check is something you would not want to do in production.

For troubleshooting though or if you app not yet has a health endpoint (I wonder why… change that!) it could be an option.

With a customization you could use the custom health check to simply fake a successful check like so:
[source,yaml]
--
resource.customizations: |
    core/v1/Service:
        health.lua: |
          check = {}
          check.status = "up"
          return check 
--

With this you could also fake a failing health check and test your deployments.
