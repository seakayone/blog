:summary:Very short notes on EuroSciPy 2016.

Being a Java and (sometimes) Scala developer on a daily basis I have thought to give it a try and take a look beyond my own nose.
Thus, I have been attended the https://www.euroscipy.org/2016/program/[EuroSciPy Conference 2016].

These are some talks I really enjoyed and seem worthy of mention:

* http://gael-varoquaux.info/[Gael Varoquaux]: Writing Code for Science
* http://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/~robitaille/[Thomas Robitaille]: https://www.euroscipy.org/2016/schedule/sessions/25/[Interactive multi-dimensional data exploration and linking with Glue]
* http://ogrisel.com/[Olivier Grisel]: https://www.euroscipy.org/2016/schedule/sessions/21/[Cluster Computing with Docker]
* Holger Peters: https://www.euroscipy.org/2016/schedule/sessions/30/[Data Science, Python and the Functional Programming Revolution]
