Java has made https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare[the billion dollar mistake]. Its creators decided it is a good idea to implement the `null` reference. This reference leads developers having to deal a lot with unexpected behaviours and the ubiquitious `NullPointerException`. The problem with `null` is that it does not provide convenient ways to deal with its presence other than checking for its existence. This way it is subverting any type system, making the code hard to read and debug and possibly leads to bad design.

Have you ever seen code with lots of nested if statements and cringed?


[source, java]
--
Foo foo = someMethodWhichReturnsFooOrNull();
if (foo != null) {
  Bar bar = foo.getBar(); // foo.getBar() returns Bar or null
  if (bar != null) {
    bar.doBaz();
  }
}
--

Using Java 8's `Optional<T>` type and method references we could simplify the above code to look like this:

[source, java]
--
someMethodWhichReturnsOptionalFoo()
  .flatMap(Foo::getBarOptional())
  .ifPresent(Bar::doBaz);
--

IMHO this would make the code not only shorter but also easier to read. The `Optional` seems to sooth our pain. Essentially `Optional` models the behaviour that a value can be present or absent and this way provides certain operations which will be executed if and only if the value is present seemingly making the dreaded `NullPointerException` vanish.

All good, right? This should allow us to write better code in terms of readability and null safeness. Not entirely: Unfortunately Java still allows to return null for any method. This means that even methods with a return value of `Optional` can actually return `null`. In the example above for example if the `getBarOptional` method returns `null` we would get a `NullPointerException` from the `flatMap` as this (https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/08/optional-broken/[admittedly awkwardly]) requires the return value to be not `null`.

So we are back at square one leaving developers behind with only self-discipline and code. With `Optional` the code will at least be more readable though.

In a later article I will present a way how to statically analyse our code and ensuring that `null` is never returned accidentally. I will also show how to use annotations to make it clearer for a developer that one has to deal with `null`, making writing Java more like the Kotlin way of handling `null` in that preventing the use of `null` will become the default way of writing code.
